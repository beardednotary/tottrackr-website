        <h2>2. How We Store Your Data</h2>
        <p>All your data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not transmit, upload, or store your data on external servers. Your baby's information never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your data with third parties. Period.</p>
        
        <p>The only way your data leaves your device is if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the "Export Data" feature to share reports via email or messaging apps (your choice)</li>
            <li>Enable the optional Premium sync feature (data is encrypted and stored securely on Firebase)</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Only you and caregivers you explicitly invite can access your data</li>
            <li>We cannot access, view, or use your synced data</li>
            <li>You can disable sync and delete cloud data at any time from Settings</li>
        </ul>
